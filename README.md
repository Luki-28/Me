# Hi there, I'm Łukasz! 👋

I'm a young developer супер pumped about **Artificial Intelligence** and building cool, impactful stuff. My journey is all about learning, creating, and exploring the endless possibilities of AI.

### 🧠 AI Enthusiast & Creator
I'm totally hooked on Artificial Intelligence and its potential to change how we learn, work, and interact with the world. My goal is to build solutions that are not just smart, but also intuitive and genuinely helpful.

### 🚀 Currently Building: "Naukado"
This is my main gig right now! "Naukado" is an AI-powered educational platform I'm developing from scratch.
*   **Tech Stack (Naukado):** React, TypeScript, Node.js, with powerful AI models like Google Gemini & Qwen at its core.
*   **Status:** It's a dynamic work-in-progress! I'm constantly adding new features, refining existing ones, and pushing the boundaries of what an AI learning companion can be.

### 🛠️ My Development Style & Philosophy
I love diving deep into the "why" and "what" – coming up with the big ideas and the overall architecture for a product. Then, I enjoy guiding advanced AI tools (like [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)) to help me bring that vision to life efficiently. Think of me as more of an **AI-assisted architect and product visionary** than a traditional hands-on coder. My focus is on the intelligent design and a smart development process.

### 🌱 Always Learning & Growing
The tech world, especially AI, moves at lightning speed, and I'm all in for the ride!
*   Constantly exploring new technologies and development techniques.
*   Diving into how things work under the hood.
*   Currently flipping through Peter Thiel's "Zero to One" for some startup wisdom and insights into building innovative ventures.
*   Actively looking to expand my skills, including a deeper dive into Python and the Machine Learning ecosystem.

### 💡 Beyond the Code
My curiosity doesn't stop at just technology.
*   I've got a soft spot for how tech, particularly AI, can intersect with and revolutionize other fields, like **medicine** and healthcare.
*   Passionate about creating user-centric experiences.
