Hey everyone! 👋 I'm Łukasz, a young dev супер pumped about AI and building cool stuff.

Here's a bit about me & what I'm up to:

🧠 AI Enthusiast & Creator: Totally hooked on Artificial Intelligence and how it can change things.
🚀 Building "Naukado": My main gig right now! It's an AI-powered educational platform I'm developing from scratch (think React, TS, Node.js, with Gemini & Qwen brains). It's a work-in-progress, always adding new features!
🛠️ My Dev Style: I love coming up with the big ideas for a product and then guiding AI tools (like Cursor) to help me build it out. More архитектора niż a hands-on coder, you know?
🌱 Always Learning: Constantly exploring new tech, diving into how things work, and trying to get better. Currently flipping through 'Zero to One' for some startup wisdom.
💡 Beyond Code: Got a soft spot for how tech can mix with other fields, like medicine.
